Three-dimensional visualization showing the moai mesh (n = 5,150 vertices) colored by height, with the center of mass indicated by a red sphere located at 40.6% of the statue's total height (2.98 m above base in a 7.35 m tall moai). The vertical dashed line shows the projection of the center of mass to the base plane, and the dotted vertical line indicates a true vertical reference from the base center. Text annotations show the forward lean angle of 6.5° and the moai dimensions (height: 7.35 m, width: 2.89 m). (B) Top-down view showing the D-shaped base outline (blue) derived from a horizontal cross-section 10 cm above the base. The center of mass (red circle) projects within the base footprint, positioned 23.2 cm left and 34.0 cm backward from the geometric base center (blue cross). A solid black arrow connects the base center to the center of mass projection, while a green arrow indicates the lean direction. The base measures 2.64 m × 2.10 m, with the center of mass located 139 cm behind the front edge. All axes show scaled coordinates in meters, preserving the actual moai dimensions.
